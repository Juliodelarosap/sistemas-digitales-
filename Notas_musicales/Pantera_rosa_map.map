WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   mux/sel[7]_GND_19_o_Mux_17_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     14
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:        14
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   256 out of   1,430   17%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       572 out of   2,860   20%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          940
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           555 out of     940   59%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               7 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net mux/_n0035 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   111 out of   1,430    7%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       264 out of   2,860    9%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          376
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           226 out of     376   60%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               1 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
